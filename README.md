# ML-from-scratch2
The project aims to learn the fundemental knowledge on machine learning and to not rely too heavily on libraries.
The project contains multiple parts:
  designing a Web application
  Data creation using User input
  Data analysis of user input
  Machine learning algoriths for predicting the next data point.
This Project creates a canvas that the user can draw on and it will predict what the user is drawing based on a few items that user should draw.
